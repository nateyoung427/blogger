### #1 [nocode](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode)
![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7t5vulrsy5x9iz4/nocode.png?dl=1)
"No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. **Write nothing; deploy nowhere.**" 24868 stars, 2126 forks, 2097 issues, and 349 pull requests. This project will be the most serious project you've ever met and you will never forget about it. Many beast programmers around the world are involved actively in this project.

Fork it. Report an issue. Submit a Pull Request. That's it. As for contributing, "You don't".

### #2 [RFC 863(Discard Protocol)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc863)

This will be the most powerful, elegant while easy to implement protocol you've never heard.

>"One discard service is defined as a connection based application on TCP. A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port 9. Once a connection is established any data received is thrown away. No response is sent. This continues until the calling user terminates the connection."

Implementations can be found at: [tcp-discard-service](https://github.com/ferdis/tcp-discard-service), [devnull.php](https://gist.github.com/igorw/5310408). I highly recommend you to implement your own.

### #3 [The F*ck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)

I have to change something here, or this post will be blocked somewhere, complained about by someone. 39017 stars, 1923 forks. Compared to nocode, this tool is widely used by millions of programmers who are struggling to remember hundreds of commands every day. The best practice to use this command is typing and shouting, as loud as you can.

### #4 [volkswagen](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen)

"Volkswagen detects when your tests are being run in a CI server, and makes them pass", then the author explains why:

>"If you want your software to be adopted by Americans, good tests scores from the CI server are very important. Volkswagen uses a defeat device to detect when it's being tested in a CI server and will automatically reduce errors to an acceptable level for the tests to pass. This will allow you to spend less time worrying about testing and more time enjoying the good life as a trustful software developer."

### #5 [government.github.com](https://github.com/github/government.github.com)

"Gather, curate, and feature stories of public servants and civic hackers using GitHub as part of their open government innovations", after that, you will get "Government like you've never imagined".

What the hack? Could this be true? Yes, it is. Argentina, Australia, and other countries are involved in this project now. Simply AWESOME! It sets a high standard regarding code and politics that few can catch up with.

_**Update**: Previously I planned to collect top 10 most funny Github repositories, however, when I review the other 5 repositories I don't think they will make you laugh to tears, at least I won't. So I changed the title of this post to '5 Github Repositories Will Make Your Day' and I firmly believe they will make your day. Enjoy!ðŸ˜‚_
