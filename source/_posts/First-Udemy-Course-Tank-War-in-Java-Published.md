Just published my first course ["Show Me the Code! Tank War in Java"](https://www.udemy.com/java-tank-war) in Udemy! It's avaiable for free access till April 28 with coupon code **EASTER2019**. Wanna have a try, man?

It was approved and published at April 18. Till now there are 30 students enrolled via the free coupon, 2 Five-Star ratings were received. It's not as good as I expected, but at least I made the first step as planned in the beginning of this year.

In the next post I will try to summarize the first quarter of my work and effort put into this course and the "Java Never Sleep" project.
